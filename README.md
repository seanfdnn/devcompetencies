# Software Developer Competencies
A collection of thoughts about "what makes a good developer"

## Personal Workflow / IDE Use
* Anti-Patterns: 
** Frequent use of mouse for programming tasks. Navigates through code and files and performs operations using mouse. 
** Is unaware of inefficiencies in personal workflow and does not invest thought or effort into 
* Patterns: 
** Can navigate code and utilize IDE using memorized shortcut keys with extremely infrequent use of mouse 
** Is self-aware of inefficiencies in personal workflow; has invested thought and effort into honing workflow, IDE configuration, tooling; continues to invest thought and effort in the pursuit of improving workflow 

## Code Structure and Clean Code
* Anti-Patterns
** Prolific multi-level nesting of code blocks 
** Many functions/methods longer than 30 - 50 lines that have not been broken up 
* Patterns
** 

## Refactoring
* Anti-Patterns
** Continuously "kludges" new functionality into existing code -- attempts as much as possible to add new code while avoiding touching existing code and avoiding re-factoring
* Patterns
** Can accurately describe refactoring actions in terms of Martin Fowler's "Refactoring" terms such as "extract method", "extract interface", "pull-up member variable" etc...

## Source Control / Configuration Management
* Anti-Patterns
** Doesn't use source control 
** 
* Patterns
** Checks in code to mainline 
* Advanced

## Computer Science

## Troubleshooting
* Anti-Patterns:
** 

## Eliciting the Problem Space

## User-Centric Design

## Leadership

## Management
